    <h2><u>User Interface / User Experience</u></h2>
  </strong>
  <h3>User Interface (UI) Design</h3>
  <p>User interface (UI) design is the process of making interfaces in software or computerized devices with a focus on looks or style. Designers aim to create designs users will find easy to use and pleasurable. UI design typically refers to
    graphical user interfaces but also includes others, such as voice-controlled ones.</p>
  <h3>User Experience (UX) Design</h3>
  <p>User experience (UX) refers to any interaction a user has with a product or service. UX design considers each and every element that shapes this experience, how it makes the user feel, and how easy it is for the user to accomplish their desired
    tasks. This could be anything from how a physical product feels in your hand, to how straightforward the checkout process is when buying something online. The goal of UX design is to create easy, efficient, relevant and all-round pleasant
    experiences for the user.

    UX designers combine market research, product development, strategy and design to create seamless user experiences for products, services and processes. They build a bridge to the customer, helping the company to better understand — and fulfil —
    their needs and expectations.</p>
  <h3>Benefits of UI / UX Design</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Customer Acquisition</strong>Successful user experience and design provide a competitive advantage. They will likely overtake price as key brand differentiators that attract new customers. (And who doesn’t want more new customers?)
      Great enterprise UI/UX is more than just effective product design - it’s good business.</li>
    <li><strong>Customer Retention</strong> By building an enterprise application that’s beautiful and intuitive, more people will want to use it, and more importantly, keep using it. In this digital world, customer retention is increasingly
      important as competition grows with every technological advancement.</li>
    <li><strong>Lower Support Costs</strong> A well-designed app just works. If an application is poorly designed, there will be an increased need for training, documentation, and support later, which translates into higher costs. An app that is
      intuitive and easy to use puts less stress on both employees and the bottom line.</li>
    <li><strong>Increased Productivity</strong>Better user experience leads to productivity improvements. When you consider the increased productivity over the number of users and hours of day each user is active, the financial impact is readily
      apparent - and substantial.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduces Deveopment Time</strong>An estimated 50% of engineering time is spent redoing work to fix mistakes that could have been avoided, like incorrect assumptions about how users will behave, confusing navigation that causes users to
      get stuck or lost, a new feature that nobody wants to use, or a design choice that isn’t accessible. Making sure the design is done right – and done well – the first time around will prevent future headaches.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>With technology changing rapidly, it’s more important than ever for companies to embrace UI/UX design - not as a one-time event, but as a fluid continuous part of a long-term business strategy.</p>
